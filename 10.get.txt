# 1. Initialize a new local Git repository:
git init

# 2. Create a new file named "index.html" with some basic HTML content.

# 3. Add the "index.html" file to the staging area:
git add index.html

# 4. Commit the "index.html" file to the local repository:
git commit -m "1. Initial commit - Added index.html"

# 5. Create three branches named "auth," "payment," and "security":
git branch auth
git branch payment
git branch security

# 6. Switch to the "auth" branch:
git checkout auth

# 7. In the "auth" branch, make a small change to the "index.html" file and commit the changes directly:
echo "<p>Auth branch change</p>" >> index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "2. Made a small change in the auth branch"

# 8. Switch to the "payment" branch:
git checkout payment

# 9. In the "payment" branch, make another small change to the "index.html" file and commit the changes directly:
echo "<p>Payment branch change</p>" >> index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "3. Made a small change in the payment branch"

# 10. Switch to the "security" branch:
git checkout security

# 11. In the "security" branch, make yet another small change to the "index.html" file and commit the changes directly:
echo "<p>Security branch change</p>" >> index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "4. Made a small change in the security branch"

# 12. Merge the changes from the "auth" branch into the "payment" branch:
git checkout payment
git merge auth
